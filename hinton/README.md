[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A CUDA-enabled PyTorch implementation of CapsNet (Capsule Network) based on this paper:
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

The current `test error is 0.21%` and the `best test error is 0.20%`. The current `test accuracy is 99.31%` and the `best test accuracy is 99.32%`.

**What is a Capsule**

> A Capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or object part.

You can learn more about Capsule Networks [here](#learning-resources).

**Why another CapsNet implementation?**

I wanted a decent PyTorch implementation of CapsNet and I couldn't find one at the point when I started. The goal of this implementation is focus to help newcomers learn and understand the CapsNet architecture and the idea of Capsules. The implementation is **NOT** focus on rigorous correctness of the results. In addition, the codes are not optimized for speed. To help us read and understand the codes easier, the codes comes with ample comments and the Python classes and functions are documented with Python docstring.

I will try my best to check and fix issues reported. Contributions are highly welcomed. If you find any bugs or errors in the codes, please do not hesitate to open an issue or a pull request. Thank you.

**Status and Latest Updates:**

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

**Datasets**

The model was trained on the standard [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data.

*Note: you don't have to manually download, preprocess, and load the MNIST dataset as [TorchVision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) will take care of this step for you.*

I have tried using other datasets. See the [Other Datasets](#other-datasets) section below for more details.

## Usage

### Training and Evaluation
**Step 1.**
Clone this repository with ``git`` and install project dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cedrickchee/capsule-net-pytorch.git
$ cd capsule-net-pytorch
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2.** 
Start the CapsNet on MNIST training and evaluation:

- Training with default settings:
```bash
$ python main.py
```

- Training on 8 GPUs with 30 epochs and 1 routing iteration:
```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python main.py --epochs 30 --num-routing 1 --threads 16 --batch-size 128 --test-batch-size 128
```

**Step 3.**
Test a pre-trained model:

If you have trained a model in Step 2 above, then the weights for the trained model will be saved to `results/trained_model/model_epoch_10.pth`. [WIP] Now just run the following command to get test results.

```bash
$ python main.py --is-training 0 --weights results/trained_model/model_epoch_10.pth
```

### Pre-trained Model

You can download the weights for the pre-trained model from my Google Drive. We saved the weights (model state dict) and the optimizer state for the model at the end of every training epoch.

- Weights from [epoch 50 checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1lYtOMSreP4I9hr9un4DsBJZrzodI6l2d) [84 MB].
- Weights from [epoch 40 to 50](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1VMuVtJrecz47czsT5HqLxZpFjkLoMKaL) checkpoints [928 MB].

Uncompress and put the weights (.pth files) into `./results/trained_model/`.

*Note: the model was **last trained** on 2017-11-26 and the weights **last updated** on 2017-11-28.*

### TensorBoard

We logged the training and test losses and accuracies using tensorboardX. TensorBoard helps us visualize how the machine learn over time. We can visualize statistics, such as how the objective function is changing or weights or accuracy varied during training.

TensorBoard operates by reading TensorFlow data (events files).

#### How to Use TensorBoard

1. Download a [copy of the events files](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1lZVffeZTkUQfSxmZmYDViRzmhb59wBWL) for the latest run from my Google Drive.
2. Uncompress the file and put it into `./runs`.
3. Check to ensure you have installed tensorflow (CPU version). We need this for TensorBoard server and dashboard.
4. Start TensorBoard.
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir runs
```
5. Open TensorBoard dashboard in your web browser using this URL: http://localhost:6006

### Other Datasets

#### CIFAR10

In the spirit of experiment, I have tried using other datasets. I have updated the implementation so that it supports and works with CIFAR10. Need to note that I have not tested throughly our capsule model on CIFAR10.

Here's how we can train and test the model on CIFAR10 by running the following commands.

```bash
python main.py --dataset cifar10 --num-conv-in-channel 3 --input-width 32 --input-height 32 --primary-unit-size 2048 --epochs 80 --num-routing 1 --use-reconstruction-loss yes --regularization-scale 0.0005
```
